/*
ðŸ’¥Implicit type conversion (also known as coercion) is the conversion of one type of data to another type automatically by the compiler when needed. It happens automatically when:

  ðŸ”¸ Operations are performed on values of different data types.

  ðŸ”¸ If you pass an argument to a function that expects a different data type.

  ðŸ”¸ Assigning a value of one data type to a variable of another data type.
